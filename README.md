# Merkle Distribution

## Signature-periodic drop

Based on [1inch's Signature-based drop](https://github.com/1inch/merkle-distribution.git) with several changes:

1. Merkle tree can be replaced as it's done in [Sequential cumulative Merkle Tree drop](https://github.com/1inch/merkle-distribution?tab=readme-ov-file#sequential-cumulative-merkle-tree-drops)
2. Drops native token
3. Allow claim once in configurable period.
